Git Commands : 

1) git init : it intialized the repository as a Git Repository

There are three steps in Git repository
1) wroking directory
2) staging area
3) git directory(repository)

If we want to commit any file then we have to take this file in staging area

working --> stage --> git repository

2) git add .  :  All files were taken to staging area ( after running this command  we can commit )

3) git commit -m "Give Some name to changes" : commits the file

4) git config  --global user.name  "name" : you can give your name when you are doing changes in file

5) git config  --global user.email  "email" : you can give your email when you are doing changes in file

6) git log : you can see all the changes done in  git repository
